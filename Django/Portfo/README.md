# Personal Portfolio Page

Welcome to my personal portfolio page! This website serves as an introduction to who I am and my work. It’s not just
about me – you’ll also find some exciting apps, games, and content here that I’ve developed.

## Features

- **About Me**: Learn about my journey, skills, and experiences.
- **Apps and Games**: Discover a collection of applications and games that are completely free to use.
- **Content Library**: Explore engaging content, all available for free.
- **Ad-Supported Free Use**: Some apps and content may include non-intrusive advertisements to support ongoing development.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to introduce an optional donation system. If you enjoy the apps and games here and would like an
ad-free experience, you’ll have the option to donate a small yearly amount as an act of kindness. For now, everything is
free, and the donation system is not yet functional.
